### What should you expect from the hackathon?

At this ARM sponsored event you bring your laptop and get the opportunity to use ARM mbed microcontrollers, sensors, explore the ARM mbed OS, ARM device servers and other products in the mbed eco-system. ARM engineers will teach participants how to get started with the mbed platform and be on-site for support throughout the event.

Our Theme - Wearables:
- The aim is to create an electronic device that uses the ARM mbed IoT Device Platform to develop a wearable product.
- Teams will have 24 hours to create their device.
- Prizes will be given at the end for the best designs.
- Food and drinks will also be provided.

This event is not a competition but a party. It is completely free of charge, a great place to meet new, like-minded people and all about having fun!
