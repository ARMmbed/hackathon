# ARM mbed Hackathon

## The Cambridge University Engineering Society Hackathon
Create your own ARM based mbed wearables at the 24-25th October at the University of Cambridge Department of Engineering. You can find a live feed at our [facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1492417234391358/). The official hashtags for the event are **#CUESHackathon** and **#mbed**.

Thanks to everybody for making this event possible:
- [ARM mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/) for sponsoring the prices, hardware, electronic parts, food, drinks and engineering support.
- [Cambridge University Engineering Society](https://cuengineeringsociety.org.uk/events/cues-hackathon/) for setting up the event, providing food and shelter
- [RedBearLab](http://redbearlab.com/) for giving ARM and the attendess generous discounts for their [BLEnano hardware](http://redbearlab.com/blenano/)
- [Nordic Semiconductors](https://www.mbed.com/en/partners/nordic/) for their [nRF51822 SoC](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822) Bluetooth Low Energy chip that is the heart of [BLEnano](http://redbearlab.com/blenano/) and many other IoT wearable products.

## Contributions & Prize Jury

Please submit a pull request against this repository to have your project linked in the project list bwlow:

### Active Projects
- ARM mbed Bluetooth Low Energy [example applications](https://github.com/ARMmbed/ble-examples)

### What should you expect from the hackathon?

At this ARM sponsored event you bring your laptop and get the opportunity to use ARM mbed microcontrollers, sensors, explore the ARM mbed OS, ARM device servers and other products in the mbed eco-system. ARM engineers will teach participants how to get started with the mbed platform and be on-site for support throughout the event.

Our Theme - Wearables:
- The aim is to create an electronic device that uses the ARM mbed IoT Device Platform to develop a wearable product.
- Teams will have 24 hours to create their device.
- Prizes will be given at the end for the best designs.
- Food and drinks will also be provided.

This event is not a competition but a party. It is completely free of charge, a great place to meet new, like-minded people and all about having fun!
