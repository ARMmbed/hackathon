     *
     * For efficiency, and because 16 bytes would take a large chunk of the
     * 27-byte data payload length of the Link Layer, the BLE specification adds
     * two additional UUID formats: 16-bit and 32-bit UUIDs. These shortened
     * formats can be used only with UUIDs that are defined in the Bluetooth
     * specification (i.e., that are listed by the Bluetooth SIG as standard
     * Bluetooth UUIDs).
     *
     * To reconstruct the full 128-bit UUID from the shortened version, insert
     * the 16-bit short value (indicated by xxxx, including leading zeros) into
     * the Bluetooth Base UUID:
     *
     *  0000xxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
     *
     * @note Shortening is not available for UUIDs that are not derived from the
     *       Bluetooth Base UUID. Such non-standard UUIDs are commonly called
     *       vendor-specific UUIDs. In these cases, youâ€™ll need to use the full
     *       128-bit UUID value at all times.
     *
     * @note we don't yet support 32-bit shortened UUIDs.
